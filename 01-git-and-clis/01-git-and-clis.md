# Git and Command Line Interfaces

## Stuff

## Exercises

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

2. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/beepboop271/computer-science-club), and clone your fork using `git`, [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), or any other similar method (don't download as zip, because then every time I update this repository, you won't be able to sync my changes unless you re-download the zip again).

3. If you don't already have it, install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.6 or greater).

4. If you're on Windows, I recommend installing [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) (yes, I know, ew Microsoft store, but it's made by Microsoft so why wouldn't they put it there). In addition, optionally install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for Linux on Windows (note: I use WSL 1, but I'm not too sure what WSL 2 is like). If you're on Mac or Linux, just open your terminal.

5. Run `python --version` to check what version of Python is set to `python` (you may also try `python3`, or maybe `python3.6` or `python3.8` on linux). If it does not print a version you expect, ask me about it (not sure if I will have enough time to explain this for week 1).

6. Without modifying `01-activity1.py`, print out the value of `s` after the program runs (use IDLE or interactive mode in the command line).

7. Get the program `01-activity2.py` to print the line starting with "good job", and determine the number printed on the same line.
